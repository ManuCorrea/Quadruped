# Description
Here you have different functions to communicate with Arduino Mega by USB Serial.

## TODO Upgrades
- [ ] Check extreme cases and robustness.
- [ ] Add simplier functions (here and in Arduino) to ask for a certain joint/s instead of all
- [ ] Check how SPI performs and implement it in SPI if it has better results.
